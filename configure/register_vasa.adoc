You can register VASA provide to vCenter by using either self signed certificate or CA signed certificate. Self signed certificate is generated using VMware CA handshake.

*About this task*

You need to have the CA signed certificate placed in vCenter when using the CA signed certificate method. 


*Steps*

. Navigate to vCenter server. 
. Select *Configure* > *Storage Providers*. 
. Click the *Add* icon. 
. Enter the connection information for the storage provider:  
..	Name: Any user-friendly name like "ScaleoutVP"
..	URL: `\https://<name>/virtualization/version.xml` - the name in the URL corresponds to Virtual IP provided during the OVA deployment for Single vCenter deployment (or) Domain name for Multi-vCenter deployments. Add the certificates to the URL. Same certificates are published to vCenter. 
.. Credentials: <VASA Provider username>/< VASA Provider password> provided during OVA deployment. 
. After the VASA is registered, click *OK*.   
Ensure that it is listed under Storage Provider and the status is Online. 
+
If you have placed CA signed certificate in vCenter, the VASA registration continues with CA signed certificate. Else, the handshaking fails and registration defaults to SSA certificate.
. You can register multiple vCenters to a single scaleout vp instance. 
Repeat the steps mentioned above to register multiple vCenters.
