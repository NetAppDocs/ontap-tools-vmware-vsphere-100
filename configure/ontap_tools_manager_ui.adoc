ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.0 is a Multi-tenant system, which manages multiple vCenters. An administrator needs more control over the vCenters being managed and storage backends being onboarded. 

ONTAP tools manager provides more control and power to ONTAP tools administrator, which helps in overall management of the appliance, tenants, and storage backends.

The ONTAP tools performs: 

* vCenter management - Register and unregister vCenters to ONTAP tools
* Storage backend management - Register and unregister ONTAP Storage clusters to ONTAP tools and map them to onboarded vCenters globally. 
+
Storage backend is global when added from ONTAP tools manager or commons APIs and they are local when added from the vCenter APIs.
Example: For multi-tenant setup, you can add storage backend (cluster) globally and SVM locally to use direct SVM credentials.
* Log bundle downloads

To access ONTAP tools UI, launch `\https://loadBalanceIP:8443/virtualization/ui/` from the browser and login with ONTAP tools administrator credentials provided during deployment.
