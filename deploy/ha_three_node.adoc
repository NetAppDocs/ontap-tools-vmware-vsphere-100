You can configure HA three node in either small, medium, or large configurations.

* Small HA three node contains 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM per node.
* Medium HA three node contains 12 CPUs and 24 GB RAM per node.
* Large HA three node contains 16 CPUs and 32 GB RAM per node.

*About this task*

This task gives you instructions on how to install HA three node in small, medium, or high configurations.
[NOTE]
Creating the content library is a mandatory step for deploying HA three node configuration. See link:../deploy/concept_how_to_download_ontap_tools.html[How to download ONTAP tools] for details.

[NOTE]
Before proceeding with the deployment, set the cluster's Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) on the inventory to *Conservative* during the installation of ONTAP tools.

*Steps*

. Log in to the vSphere server.
. Navigate to the content library and select your content library.
. Select *Actions* in the right side of the page and select *Import item* and import the OVA file.
. Navigate to the resource pool or the host where you want to deploy the OVA.
. Right-click the required datacenter, and select *Deploy OVF template...*.
. Select the content library where the _.ova_ file is saved, and then select *Next*.
. Select a name and folder for the virtual machine and select *Next*.
. Select the host and select *Next*
. Review the summary of the template and select *Next*.
. Read and accept the license agreement and select *Next*.
. In the *Configuration window*, select *HA three Node(small)*, *HA three Node(Medium)*, or *HA three Node(large)* configuration, depending on your requirement.
. Select the storage for the configuration and disk files, select *Next*.
. Select the destination network for each source network, select *Next*.
. Select *Customize template* > *system configuration* window. Enter the following details:
.. VASA provider username and password: This username and password is used for registering the VASA provider in the vCenter.
.. The *Enable ASUP* checkbox is selected by default.

The ASUP can be enabled or disabled only during deployment.
.. Administrator Username and Administrator Password: This is the password used to login to *ONTAP tools Manager* UI. 
.. Enter NTP server information in *NTP Servers* field. 
.. Maintenance user password: This is used to grant access to ‘Maint Console Options’.
. In the *Customize template* > *VASA Provider Certificates* window, enter the following details:
.. Check Enable Custom CA certificate check box. This is required for multi-VC enablement. In case of non multi-VC environment, ignore the check box. There is no need to mention the certificates and domain name, you need to only provide the virtual IP details.
.. Copy and paste the Root and Intermediate certificates.
.. Copy and paste the Leaf certificates and Private key.
.. Enter the Domain name with which you generated the certificate.
.. Enter the Load Balance IP details.
. In *Customize template* > *Deployment Configuration* window, enter the following details:
.. Enter a free IP Address in Virtual IP for K8s Control Plane. You need this for K8s API Server.
.. Select the checkbox against *Enable SVM scoping* option when you intend to use direct SVM. To use ONTAP cluster, do not select the checkbox.
