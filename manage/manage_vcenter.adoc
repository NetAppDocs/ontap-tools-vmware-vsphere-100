vCenters are central management platforms that allow you to control hosts, virtual machines, and storage backends.

== Add vCenter

You can add and manage multiple vCenters with one instance of ONTAP tools for VMware vCenter 10.0.

*Steps*

. Launch `\https://loadBalanceIP:8443/virtualization/ui/` from browser with ONTAP tools administrator credentials provided during deployment. 
. Select vCenters from the sidebar
. Select *ADD* to onboard vCenters with vCenter IP Address/Hostname, username, password, and port. 
. Navigate to *Storage Backend* page and select *Add to onboard storage backend* (ONTAP Cluster) with Hostname, username, password, and port. 

See link:../configure/task_configure_user_role_and_privileges.html[List of minimum privileges required for non-admin global scoped cluster user].

== Associate or Dissociate storage backend with vCenter

vCenter listing page shows the associated number of storage backends. Each vCenter has option to Associate or Disassociate a storage backend 
This task help you to create mapping between storage backend and onboarded vCenter globally.

*Steps*

. Launch `\https://loadBalanceIP:8443/virtualization/ui/` from browser with ONTAP tools administrator credentials provided during deployment. 
. Select vCenters from the sidebar.
. Click on the vertical ellipsis against the vCenter that you want to associate or dissociate with storage backends.
. Select *Associate or Dissociate storage backend* depending on what action you want to perform.

. Select vCenters from the sidebar
. Click on the vertical ellipsis against the vCenter that you want modify and select *Modify*.
. Modify the vCenter details and select *Modify*.

== Remove vCenter

== Manage Storage threshold

----
GET​/virtualization​/api​/v1​/vcenters​/{vcguid}​/storage-thresholds
----

Examples:
Get the Storage thresholds per vcenter by vcenter guid
----
GET "/api/v1/vcenters/beded9ad-6bbb-4c9e-b4c6-691250bfe2da/storage-thresholds"
----

Use the following PATCH configure alarm for volume and aggregate to generate notification when configured threshold limits are reached. 
----
PATCH​/virtualization​/api​/v1​/vcenters​/{vcguid}​/storage-thresholds
----

Examples:
Update the Storage thresholds per vcenter by vcenter guid. Default limits are 80% for nearly-full and 90% for full.
